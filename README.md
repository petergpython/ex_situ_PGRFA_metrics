names of columns: use MCPD standard as much as possible rather than arbitrary labels. MCPD standard can be found here: https://cgspace.cgiar.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/7947d48c-5cf1-4164-8c61-fa276d658463/content![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b95cc8cb-f982-4a21-ab18-c4e36a6aeeef)
